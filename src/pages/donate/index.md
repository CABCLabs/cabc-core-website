<p>The Centre for Analytics and Behavioural Change (CABC) is a Section 18a non-profit organisation that exists to foster social cohesion through healthy online conversations between active citizens who are concerned about the state of society today. We actively track and counter mis/disinformation, hate speech and divisive rhetoric, and disseminate fact and evidence-based information. In doing so, we help support the creation of a more informed citizenry and preserve constitutionalism and democracy.</p><p>


Our programmes use a blend of advanced social media analytics and research, engagement, dialogue, advocacy and creative content. These programmes have the power to reach millions of people. We work on a variety of social themes including; racism, ethnic prejudice, xenophobia, public unrest, misogyny, gender-based violence, LGBTQI rights, extremism, sustainability and HIV/AIDS. </p>
<p>By donating to us, you are contributing to the creation of a better society for all those who live in it. All donations are tax-deductible, and we will issue you with a certificate after receiving your donation should you require one. No contribution is too small.
