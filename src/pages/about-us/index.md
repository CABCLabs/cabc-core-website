The Centre for Analytics and Behavioural Change (CABC) is a non-profit organisation that was formed in 2017 to act in the public interest. 

Our innovation is in our collaboration. By combining our collective skills, knowledge and experience we aim to effect positive behavioural change, whether for social upliftment or environmental benefit, or both. Right now, our main areas of focus are social cohesion (e.g. racism, xenophobia, homophobia, gender-based violence), narrative manipulation, sustainability, climate change and public health (HIV/AIDS/Covid-19 and other communicable diseases). 

The CABC is incubated at the Graduate School of Business (GSB) at the University of Cape Town (UCT). The team is drawn from various organisations including the GSB, the Alan Gray Centre for Values Based Leadership, the Citizen Research and Dialogue Centres and the Cape Peninsula University of Technology. Our team covers a wide range of skills, including academia, technology, research analytics, dialogue facilitation, conflict mediation, communication, and advertising.

We have established an intern programme which includes PHD candidates and MBA graduates who work on our projects, helping with data analysis, research and insights.
