description: The Centre for Analytics and Behavioural Change (CABC) is based at
  the Centre for Values Based Leadership at UCT's Graduate School of Business.
  The Centre uses social media (SoMe) dialogue and analytics to unearth emerging
  fractures in social cohesion in South Africa during the COVID-19 crisis. The
  CABC also provides analysis on other issues through a SoMe lens that threaten
  the fragile fabric of South African society through public opinion.
