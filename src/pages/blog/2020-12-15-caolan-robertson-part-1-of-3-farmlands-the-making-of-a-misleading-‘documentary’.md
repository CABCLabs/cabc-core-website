title: Caolan Robertson - Part 1 of 3. farmlands - The Making of a Misleading
  ‘Documentary’
date: 2020-12-14T15:11:29.134Z
description: Caolan Robertson (pronounced “kay-lin) was one of the central
  figures in making right-wing politics mainstream, he worked with people like
  Tommy Robinson and helped them move from ‘fringe’ to mainstream political
  commentators. Caolan has since distanced himself from right-wing politics and
  is now working for ByLine Times. He now works to undo the work he did before.
  Caolan is going to be interviewed in a feature piece in the New York Times in
  the next few months. This interview that Caolan did exclusively with the CABC
  is one of his first public appearances since leaving the right-wing political
  media space. Lauren Southern’s 2018 documentary ‘Farmlands’ is the
  most-watched documentary on the white-genocide narrative in South Africa.
  Caolan Robertson, and his partner George Llewelyn-John, produced, wrote and
  filmed Farmlands (and Borderless) with Lauren Southern. In this episode Caolan
  explains how Farmlands was filmed, and the ideas behind the documentary.
  Caolan discusses his discomfort with the film and the fact that even though
  they knew during filming that there was no white genocide taking place in
  South Africa, that argument runs throughout the film.
