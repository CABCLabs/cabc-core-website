description: "In a high-stakes virtual life where fresh news and new “likes” can
  mean power and income, the spreading of vital information that sparks emotion
  and harnesses a following could be a powerful tool for good. But what if
  digital manipulation goes over to the dark side and targeted online campaigns
  bring about real-world hatred, conflict, confusion and harm? Carte Blanche
  investigates who and what lies behind misdirected hashtags on South African
  social media, intended to manipulate and exploit users. We analyse
  disinformation trends and meet the investigators who are unpacking fakes to
  help identify and combat the damage. "
