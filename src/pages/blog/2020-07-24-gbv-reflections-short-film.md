description: South Africa has the highest levels of gender-based violence in the
  world, with intimate partner violence being the most common. Violence against
  girls and women is a men's issue, because it is a learned behaviour,
  disrespect and abuse of women has become normalised in our society.

It's time for men to reflect on the part they play in this cycle of misogyny and violence, and to be part of the solution. Enough is enough.
