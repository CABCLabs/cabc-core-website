description: South Africans on Twitter are witnessing the rise of an influential
  anti-immigrant lobby and thousands, captured by a make-believe character,
  ‘Lerato Pillay’, have unwittingly become complicit in the explosion of a
  weaponised conversation. Now, an analysis of the social media conversation by
  the Centre for Analytics and Behavioural Change has deemed uLerato to be part
  of a ‘dangerously orchestrated narrative’ that has affected at least 50,000
  accounts so far.
