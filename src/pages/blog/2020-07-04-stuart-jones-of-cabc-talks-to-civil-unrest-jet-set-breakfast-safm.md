description: The Centre for Analytics and Behavioural Change (CABC) is based at
  the Allan Gray Centre for Values Based Leadership at UCT's Graduate School of
  Business. The Centre uses social media (SoMe) dialogue and analytics to
  unearth emerging fractures in social cohesion in South Africa during the
  COVID-19 crisis. The CABC also provides analysis on other issues through a
  SoMe lens that threaten the fragile fabric of South African society through
  public opinion.
