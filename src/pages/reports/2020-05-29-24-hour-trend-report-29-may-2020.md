Malema called for hard lockdown measures, like compulsory quarantine.The EFF Official account tweeted clips from the conference. [One tweet reminded](https://twitter.com/EFFSouthAfrica/status/1265969663537827840) South Africans that the EFF had called for compulsory quarantine at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The EFF proposed Robben Island for a quarantine site, but said it would not happen because “Government is scared of white people”. Malema [explained](https://twitter.com/EFFSouthAfrica/status/1265967161291476992) that the EFF was against the sale of alcohol, as it would increase the load on hospitals, and there would be no space for COVID-19 patients.\
[@Siseko_Soga tweeted](https://twitter.com/Siseko_Soga/status/1265968991492808704), quoting Malema, that “Alcohol is: - destructive - destroys families - contributes to unprotected sex and spread of diseases - contributes to domestic violence” This tweet, posted at 13:31 yesterday, had been liked 4 600 times and retweeted 2 000 times by 09:00 today.\
The EFF was against the reopening of the mines.

Not at work, cleaning kitchens & gardens of the boers. If this is the end, then it must not find us on our knees & chains, but with our boots on”.[He tweeted](https://twitter.com/MbuyiseniNdlozi/status/1265966439229460480) using #StayAway and #StayatHome.\

**Level 3 Regulations**

Lockdown level 3 regulations was a big topic on social media and news cycles yesterday, trending as the second biggest topic for the day.\

This post reached about 133 000 people yesterday and Level 3 conversations dominated social media for the rest of the day.\
Alcohol sales became a hot topic: the announcement that:“Alcohol will be on sale on Level 3 from Mon to Thurs, 9am to 5pm” came in as the [number 5 post](https://twitter.com/News24/status/1265985449677533184) by reach for the day.\
The Presidency’s official Twitter [post](https://twitter.com/PresidencyZA/status/1266080508422819845) also garnered significant attention with over 700 likes, retweets and comments by this morning. The post asked South Africans to “work together to protect lives & continue to observe vital social distancing & hygiene practices to curb the spread of COVID-19”.\
A [post by the DA](https://twitter.com/Our_DA/status/1266054886166233093), which received almost 550 likes, retweets and comments yesterday, accused the Government of losing the plot in the fight against COVID-19: “Instead, their focus has shifted to undermining the hard-fought freedoms of all South Africans”.\

Many religious leaders have decided to keep the doors to their places of worship closed. The Muslim Judicial Council advised mosques in the Western Cape to remain closed for another month during level 3. The Claremont Main Road mosque also decided to stay closed, in a [post](https://twitter.com/ShuaibManjra/status/1265738399354425344) that was widely shared, garnering over 1 500 likes, retweets and comments.

**Testing backlog**

Western Cape Premier Alan Winde said the national backlog for COVID-19 testing was 100 000 tests. Winde said the WC provincial testing strategy had changed: instead of testing as many potential contacts of confirmed cases as possible, tests were now reserved for patients in hospitals.

Later in the day, [@News24](https://twitter.com/News24/status/1266040853312790533) tweeted confirmation that the Department of Health acting DG, Dr Anban Pillay, said the National Health Laboratory Services had a backlog of 80 000 tests for COVID-19.

**Disinformation through humour**

While online jokes about a famous Cape Town club being a place of worship for some made the rounds, some accounts used humour to start conversations with more serious, and more sinister, undertones.\
After the National Coronavirus Command Council released level 3 regulations, some Twitter users poked fun at rules they deemed to be arbitrary. At 18:16 an account called[@Propaganda24](https://twitter.com/Propoganda24)[tweeted](https://twitter.com/Propoganda24/status/1266040615051169792)for the first time since 2018: “Ramaphosa says that Coronavirus regulations will remain in place until the middle class is completely eliminated”. By this morning. the post had been liked 268 times and retweeted 153 times. In another attempt to spread social discord, the fake news page went on to[tweet](https://twitter.com/Propoganda24/status/1266075817542639617)at 20:36 that “Dlamini Zuma says the communist takeover of South Africa is well on track. The Whites don’t even realise, they are all watching DSTV.” This post was retweeted 74 times by this morning, and not all readers seem to be aware that the quote is fake. Some commented that the current ANC and EFF are “black Nazi’s” or “Zimbabwe 2.0”. At 21:00, the account tweeted more false information, saying government had unexpectedly lifted the ban on the sale of cigarettes at level 3. The sale of tobacco products remains banned under level 3.

**Hairdressing to impress**
