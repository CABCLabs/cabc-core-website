It is an obstacle to women living dignified lives, free from fear.” This post has been retweeted more than 800 times. This was followed by: “What has the government done about it? They lied and told us that all accused sexual offenders would not be granted bail. Oh and that useless 16 days of activism thing they did last year”.

**Inequality persists**

Conversation around deep inequalities in South Africa around race, class, and income trended on social media yesterday.

F1 driver Lewis Hamilton [tweeted](https://twitter.com/LewisHamilton/status/1295424442944774144): “One day I hope we’ll all be seen as equal. Until then, it’s #BlackLivesMatter always.” His post received 37 000 likes and more than 5 000 retweets and comments.

Influencer Steven Crowder authored a [tweet](https://twitter.com/scrowder/status/1295677320192307200) expressing an opposing viewpoint: “Good morning to everyone but Antifa and #BlackLivesMatter.” Crowder’s post also gained traction with 14 000 likes and 1 400 comments and shares. Most comments supported his opposition to the Antifa and Black Lives Matter movements.

News 24 [tweeted](https://twitter.com/News24/status/1295783084772777992) an article based on a quote by the EFF’s Floyd Shivambu: “there is no black person that can be racist”. He also said that “the death of George Floyd is an opportunity for the world to deal with racism.” The post garnered over 1 000 likes and 400 retweets and comments. Some agreed with Shivambu, saying: “Only white people can be racists.” Others disagreed: “the definition of racism it means when a certain race of people believe that they are superior to others, so tell me with what is happening to blacks all around the world is it possible for us to think that we are superior??”

@MatlhagaKebo [tweet](https://twitter.com/MatlhagaKebo/status/1295421661370617862)ed about South Africa’s middle class and the NSFAS (National Student Financial Aid Scheme), posting a statement from NSFAS about the recent unfunding of 5 000 students and claiming it was a result of corruption. The user highlighted the difficulty experienced by middle class students: “they carry the tax system on their backs and yet, their children are too rich for NSFAS but too poor to afford their own fees.” The post received over 1 600 comments and retweets and 3 000 likes.

@TheRealJKhanye [wrote](https://twitter.com/TheRealJKhanye/status/1295670067456352261): “it feels good to have my own car again” in a post that was well received on Twitter with 500 comments and retweets and nearly 10 000 likes.

The caption read “Worked so hard, God knows.” This tweet was liked 5 000 times and was commented on and retweeted 500 times.

**Power of Love**

Amid the torrent of tweets speaking out against GBV on the day, came a few that reflected on the power of love and relationships.

@CandieModiselle authored a [tweet](https://twitter.com/CandieModiselle/status/1295721183313375239) praising the power of “being soft and in love,” reassuring other Twitter users that “one day it will all come back to you.” The post was like 1 500 times with 300 retweets and comments.

**But not everyone agreed**

@THISisLULE weighed in on the matter, [tweeting](https://twitter.com/THISisLULE/status/1295624848715153408): “As humans, I really think we have made romantic love too much of a priority. Half the time it’s not even the most enduring love but people will legit blow up their entire lives for it.” This comment gained considerable traction with 2 500 likes and 1 000 comments and retweets. Comments were largely in favour of her sentiment: “I genuinely think we can survive without romantic love,” and “I absolutely agree.”

“People are not ours to keep. When falling in love, you need to be comfortable with the fact that the person you love can pack up anytime and leave. There’s peace in that,” [shared](https://twitter.com/steviedahustler/status/1295348390763560965) @SteviedaHustle. @Cabanga Maluleka [posted](https://twitter.com/Cabangamaluleka/status/1295370675935379456) “Stop dating people who are not interested in your personal development, life is beyond McDonald's and Nando's.” Both tweets received a combined 4 200 likes and 1 317 retweets.\
