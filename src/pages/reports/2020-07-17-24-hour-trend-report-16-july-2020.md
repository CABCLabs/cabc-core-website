**Under fire**

Moments before the virtual Presidential Imbizo started yesterday, President @CyrilRamaphosa [shared](https://twitter.com/CyrilRamaphosa/status/1283431687360319488) this message on Twitter: “Looking forward to a fruitful engagement with fellow South Africans tuning in to this evening’s Imbizo on #coronavirus via their local community radio stations, news channels and participating via social media. #PresidentialImbizo”. The tweet generated 385 likes and set off a barrage of criticism.

Earlier yesterday, social media was flooding with frustration over the latest lockdown regulations. The EFF’s @MbuyiseniNdlozi [tweeted](https://twitter.com/MbuyiseniNdlozi/status/1283318398529798144): “You cannot call for schools to close & leave everything else open- it will be futile. SA MUST SHUTDOWN &: - all workers must get 3 months payment holiday. - feeding schemes must deliver food to children at home. - all businesses that close must get payment holiday from rent/bonds”. This tweet quickly gained traction, with over 1 400 retweets and 5 800 likes by this morning.

Other users shared concerns over rising unemployment and economic deterioration. @CaronWilliams_ [tweeted](https://twitter.com/CaronWilliams_/status/1283435346798280704): “Three million people have lost their jobs in SA since COVID-19 hit”. (1 200 retweets, 1 600 likes).

The ANC does not own the State. The ANC is not South Africa. The people of our country deserve better. The ANC must fall before it is too late to salvage a future from the wreck of the present.” This post received 380 retweets and 1 200 likes.

@MadiBoity echoed this in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/MadiBoity/status/1283297561227464704) that read, “Dear South Africa, We cannot continue to put the future of this country into the hands of 4 000 ANC delegates, who are bought with alcohol & cash, in deciding who our President is. Therefore, ANC must be fired & vacate office. We need best brains across the board to reboot SA.” This tweet received far more attention, with 916 retweets and over 2 400 likes.
