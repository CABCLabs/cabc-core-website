Despite the hurdles we face – cyclones, droughts, sanctions & now the Coronavirus – our goal remains constant: To reform, restructure & rebuild in order to improve the lives of our people.” (900 retweets and 1 600 likes)

This thing is simple, you must release investigative journalists like Hopewell Chin’ono, you must respect the rights of citizens to free speech and the rights of activists to organize around their causes.” (3 600 likes)

As awareness around the #Zimbabweanlivesmatter campaign grew, Twitter users became more critical of leadership in Zimbabwe and other African countries. @Ugaman01 [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Ugaman01/status/1290515956108865537) a video of armed soldiers who appear to be kicking and prodding a defenseless man lying on the floor.
