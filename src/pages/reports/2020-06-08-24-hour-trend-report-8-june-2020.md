**Pointing fingers**

Helen Zille expressed her disapproval of schools remaining closed: “this attempt to keep schools closed is highly irresponsible, and will do more damage to children’s lives than Covid. The only people who should stay home are children with dread diseases, or staff with co-morbidities”. Helen Zille’s tweet received 1 000 likes and 326 retweets, with most comments disagreeing with her opinion, especially her belief that herd immunity will stop the spread of COVID-19.

The tweet was a response to an [EWN.co.za](https://ewn.co.za/2020/06/05/despite-concourt-ruling-maimane-not-giving-up-fight-for-safe-schools) article about previous DA leader, Mmusi Maimane’s fight against the Concourt ruling to reopen schools. Maimane has advocated for schools to stay closed until proper safety measures have been implemented. Mmusi Mmaine’s [responded](https://twitter.com/MmusiMaimane/status/1269198200063307776) to Zille’s tweet in a light-hearted manner, saying she chose to ‘throw shade’ at him on his birthday.

Phumlani Majozi, a South African political researcher and commentator, named four organisations he believed were responsible for the destruction of South Africa over the past 15 years: the ANC, the SACP, Cosatu and other unions and the EFF. Some Twitter users agreed with him, while others asked him [why doesn’t start his own party](https://twitter.com/MightiJamie/status/1269200615235780609) and why he excluded organizations such as the DA, SANDF and BLF. Since posting the initial tweet, Phumlani has not commented or engaged with the tweet or the comments received.

**Xenophobia bursts out**

The hashtag #PutSouthAfricansFirst appeared in a tweet posted by [@landback at 15:09 on Sunday 07 June 2020](https://twitter.com/landback_/status/1269617514767691776/photo/1). Accompanying the tweet was an image of a petition board: “We want our country back” and an image of President Cyril Ramaphosa. The tweet states: “South Africans are busy mobilizing to protest against your government’s open borders and high immigration policies.” The post has been retweeted 64 times. Most people commenting on the post appeared to agree with the tweet, with some saying that South African citizens must be put first when it came to employment.

Over the weekend a petition was created on [Change.org](https://www.change.org/p/south-african-president-save-south-africa-from-foreigners-and-their-crimes?recruiter=1001908136&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=share_petition&utm_term=oth&recruited_by_id=a3c82db0-ce88-11e9-9fb6-9b2f04f09a32) by Nandiswa Gschwari called “Save South Africa from Foreigners and their Crimes.” The petition asked for 500 signatures and had received 459 signatures by 10:00 today. The petition claims: “Farmers are being murdered by Zimbabweans, Mozambique’s and Malawians. The youth is dying of drugs, human trafficking by Nigerians. Our country has become a paradise for all sorts of criminal activities because of its lawlessness. Please sign and help us save South Africa and re build this beautiful country.”

British political commentator Katie Hopkins, known for her right-wing stance, aired her view in [a video that was tweeted on 5 June 2020](https://twitter.com/KTHopkins/status/1268962474012938240) and viewed more than 100 000 times. The tweet that accompanies the video says: “South Africa is a glimpse into our future. Under a new development, White South Africans will be given refuge & farming opportunity in Eastern Europe. Could Eastern Europe be the place white Christians call home?” Responses were mixed, with some [White South Africans asking why](https://twitter.com/johannKruger243/status/1268965294103580673) they would need to go to eastern Europe, when South Africa was their country too?

**Resorting to humour**\
