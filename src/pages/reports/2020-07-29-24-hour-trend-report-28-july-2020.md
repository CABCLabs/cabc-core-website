**Protesting jobs**

Over the weekend, a [video](https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/western-cape/look-protests-still-disrupting-traffic-flow-in-various-areas-of-cape-town-f7d2ea3e-3795-4eff-bf3f-8bb4f0d375a7) calling for a shutdown in Cape Town circulated on social media. The speaker in the video, who is from a community group called Gatvol Capetonian said: “We’ll be shutting down because of the lack of opportunities for coloured people”. Protests erupted on Monday and demonstrators clashed with the police.

Many Twitter users have expressed concern over the anti-black sentiments coming out of these protests. @bontlemvula [tweeted](https://twitter.com/bontlemvula/status/1287702770766807040): “The “gatvol capetonians” are doing to black South Africans what black South Africans have done to black foreigners living in SA. It’s all misdirected anger and superiority complex really. Disgusting.” This tweet received 386 retweets and 690 likes.

@indiosyncratic echoed this in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/indiosyncratic/status/1287698701524361218): “anti-black coloured people identifying black people as the reason for their struggles and not WHITE PEOPLE will never not be funny”. This tweet generated 677 retweets and 1 400 likes.

@BarbierAbra [tweeted](https://twitter.com/BarbierAbra/status/1287734274976874499): “Verwoerd really did a number on us. Convinced us that being less than White, but more than Black was okay. That mentality remains in many Coloured communities today. What Gatvol doesn't get, is that their plight, is the plight of Black communities country-wide. Coloured=Black.” This was retweeted 732 times and liked over 1 400 times.

The hashtag #FightBackForSouthAfrica trended yesterday, driven by frustration over employment opportunities, with some xenophobic undertones. On Saturday @PatrioticMarc had [tweeted](https://twitter.com/PatriotMarc/status/1286869059460632576): “The ANC government want to replace South Africans with FOREIGNERS… #FightBackForSouthAfrica”. This received some attention yesterday with 149 retweets and 411 likes.

@DanzelaSpha [shared](https://twitter.com/DazelaSpha/status/1287622927010201606) an image with the message: “Xenophobia - a word used to bully black South Africans into silence. #FightBackForSouthAfrica we are not against foreigners but we want people to stay in this country legally and people who are useful to this country. Tito Mboweni said small business must be South Africans only. We want to see that happening.” This tweet generated 244 retweets and 963 likes.

Other users urged South African employers to prioritise employing South Africans over foreign nationals. @mudzu_thabe [tweeted](https://twitter.com/mudzu_thabe/status/1287760218433236995): “Fellow Compatriots, Let's stop supporting companies and businesses that employ foreigners to do jobs which can be done by South Africans. Let's force them to go out there and seek South Africans who need jobs. Young South Africans are hungry and need jobs #FightBackForSouthAfrica”. This tweet received 74 retweets and 139 likes.

**Stealing funds**

Finance Minister Tito Mboweni’s tweet about people stealing funds reserved for COVID-19 relief efforts was followed by many calls for him to take action against corruption. With news of an additional $4.3 billion in COVID-19 relief funding from the IMF, South African Twitter users expressed their doubt over the government’s ability to use this money for its intended purpose.

Mboweni [tweeted](https://twitter.com/tito_mboweni/status/1287503209456709632): “A tender is an ethical contract. It is not a blank cheque to deceive and steal. And stealing from unwell people! During a COVID-19 pandemic! Please people. What kind of people are these criminals?!”. He later tweeted: “We should be working together to defeat the virus. Not see this as an opportunity to defraud the State and unwell people. We are watching you and there has to be consequences. For sure. Game over!”

@ArabileG [implored](https://twitter.com/ArabileG/status/1287820514824720384) President Cyril Ramaphosa to look at responses from

South Africans on Twitter related to the government's ability to use IMF monetary aid. He concluded: “They Do Not Trust You. Do Something... Please?!”. The tweet has been retweeted more than 1 200 times and received over 3 500 likes.

[Commenting on the post](https://twitter.com/Wendy94669657/status/1287829682419900416), @Wendy94669657 pointed out that “Repayment of the IMF loan will be left to next generations, to pick up that tab. Your unreasonable bans affect generations to come. Your legacy will be a bad taste in their mouths.”

Just four minutes after @ArabileG’s tweet, @TreasuryRSA announced that the IMF executive board had approved the $4.3 billion financial support for South Africans during the COVID-19 pandemic. This tweet received more than 400 retweets.

A barrage of negative commentary followed. @MzwaneleManyi [commented](https://twitter.com/MzwaneleManyi/status/1287973781479227392) about a trust deficit, saying that the people were tired. Responding to @MzwaneleManyi’s comment, @tshidi_lee [said:](https://twitter.com/tshidi_lee/status/1287974501712564224) “at every turn anything communicated about this loan or corruption is met with so much anger and frustration”.

@sthembete [tweeted](https://twitter.com/sthembete/status/1287619801507135490) that the problem was with the ANC and that the people who Mboweni was referring to were his comrades who he should address directly in his morning meeting. This tweet was retweeted more than 1 000 times and received over 3 500 likes.

In response to Moboweni’s tweet, @justicemalala [tweeted:](https://twitter.com/justicemalala/status/1287627000450932736) “Chief, has no one told you that you guys are running the country? Have been for 26 years? You all speak here like you are civilians. Govern, man!” This post was retweeted more than 450 times and it received over 1 500 likes.

Thuli Madonsela [called on](https://twitter.com/ThuliMadonsela3/status/1287725006374543361) Mboweni to stop the ‘rot’ by implementing three proposed actions: greater transparency regarding COVID-19 contracts; passing a False Claims Act, and more funding for the SIU and Assets forfeiture unit to ensure they retrieve funds that have been misappropriated. Her tweet has been retweeted more than 450 times and has received over 1 300 likes.

**Creating Shumi**
