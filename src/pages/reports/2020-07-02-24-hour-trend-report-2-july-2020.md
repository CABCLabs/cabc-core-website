**Racism stripped bare?**

The top topic of the day was “City of Cape Town” as allegations of racism poured into Twitter yesterday, following the demolishing of a naked man’s house.

At 16:05 @IrvinJimSA [tweeted a video](https://twitter.com/IrvinJimSA/status/1278328968064544769) of an unnamed man being dragged from his informal dwelling: “These inhumane evictions by City of Cape Town Anti-Land Invasion Unit @ eThembini Kayelitsha. #LockdownSA #BlackLivesMatter must be completely rejected.”

The video shows the man being pushed to the ground repeatedly as he struggled to get back into his home. Bystanders recorded the incident on their phones and expressed their shock. But no one intervened. When the man eventually made it back into his home, members of the anti-land invasion team started tearing down the house while he was still inside. Irvin’s post was retweeted over 7 000 times by 10:00 this morning.

The City of Cape Town said on Twitter it would launch an urgent investigation into the incident, which they said was part of a City Law Enforcement Operation. Most comments expressed the view that black people were being treated with little dignity, particularly in Cape Town.

@TumiSole was outraged at the video, and said: “A host of attorneys have offered to fight the City & it’s racist policies! This isn’t the 1st time!”. This post was retweeted close to 2 000 times by this morning.

Floyd Shivambu of the EFF shared the video on Twitter in the evening [along with the tweet](https://twitter.com/FloydShivambu/status/1278394296023093249): “This is how black people continue to be treated in their own land. The city of Cape Town is continuing with the colonial and murderous barbarism that defined the colonial convicts who colonised our land from 1652. We need our land back.” This post was retweeted over 1 000 times and received 2 100 likes by this morning.

Comments included calls to action over treatment of black people. @Lebogan32666105 [commented](https://twitter.com/Lebogan32666105/status/1278399585040416768): “Giving this man land wont erase what happened today. This guy was harassed, humiliated. Abused. Today land is 1% of his problems. Focus focus”.

@pontsho_pilane [tweeted that](https://twitter.com/pontsho_pilane/status/1278363872282509312) sharing the video further dehumanised the evicted man, and asked people to stop. But many disagreed with this stance, saying such acts needed to be exposed, and the reality that black people still faced must be shared, even if it did not appeal to [bourgeois sensibilities.](https://twitter.com/diction_dog/status/1278397144920096775)

Vusi Thembekwayo [tweeted](https://twitter.com/VusiThembekwayo/status/1278411477469335552) “Just don’t forget which party runs the City of Cape Town. Don’t forget.” As criticism of the DA came in, the ANC also took flak on social media as users expressed their disapproval that the ruling political party has not taken any action over the incident.

**Just stay home**

Conversations about the COVID-19 pandemic trended across the top topics by volume again yesterday: “Home” was mentioned over 20 000 mentions, indicating that the leading narrative urged people to stay home.

This theme is closely linked to the growing conversation over whether children should go back to school. A [tweet](https://twitter.com/sbu__thegreat/status/1278333635951804416) by @daisythando arguing that grade R learners should stay home received almost 2 000 likes and was retweeted over 600 times by today.

@HulisaniRavele [requested](https://twitter.com/HulisaniRavele/status/1277891703962296321) people to “stop having these braais, stop having the little gatherings … Go to work, get the essentials, go home”. The tweet concluded “it’s not a joke”, and received 1 700 likes and 525 retweets.

@CBTS15486123 also [urged](https://twitter.com/CBTS15486123/status/1278207304907833344) people to stay home and protect themselves, noting that, although only 25 years old, “this virus nearly killed me”. The tweet included the hashtag “#level5” and received over 270 likes.

Voicing an opposing viewpoint strongly, @leboclive [tweeted,](https://twitter.com/leboclive/status/1278074923278389250) “Obviously privileged people would want us to go back to level 5 because they'll still be earning a decent salary while laying on their fancy couches and attending virtual meetings. Zero fucks about the hairdresser that provides for her whole family. I hate it here”. This tweet received over 1 300 retweets and over 4 300 likes.

Many Twitter users shared their personal experiences on coping with COVID-19. @RosieMotene shared a 9-part [thread](https://twitter.com/RosieMotene/status/1277957535996063744) about how she had treated herself, based on recommendations from medical doctors. The initial tweet received over 4 000 retweets and over 5 600 likes.

@noeleensaid [shared](https://twitter.com/noeleensaid/status/1278306666526773248) pictures of her mother, a professional nurse working on the frontline of the pandemic and saving lives. This tweet was liked over 230 times.
