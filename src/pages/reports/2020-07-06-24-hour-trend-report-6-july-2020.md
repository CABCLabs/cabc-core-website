**Xenophobia rebuked**

On Saturday night @masentle_NEO [tweeted:](https://twitter.com/masentle_NEO/status/1279504953111953410) “There is no south African owning spaza shop in Somalia.There is no south African occupied Lagos selling drugs like Nigerians in Johannesburg. It must come to an end Johannesburg is for south Africans not evil Nigerians feeding our kids with drugs”. The post has been retweeted over 300 times and received more than 800 likes by this morning.

Responding to the tweet, @law1920 *commented:* “But no one prevent you to do the same to their countries. Those kids no one force them to use drugs, they are just addicted like people with alcohol, why don't you blame liquor stores for selling alcohol? Even South Africans themselves are selling drugs, don't you see it?” They were [told to](https://twitter.com/DitiroNamanyan1/status/1279683150554300416), “stop defending nonsense wena Satan”.

Another person [commented that](https://twitter.com/OyeTomori_/status/1279733272118005762) we needed to address drug usage first, because people will continue to sell drugs if there is a demand for them, regardless of nationality.

On Sunday @Mudzu_thabe tweeted: “When foreigners kill South Africans, the South African government protects these criminals #PutSouthAfricansFirst #NigeriansMustFutsek #InfluxOfImmigrantsMustStop”. @nkulu_syamukela responded: “Can u imagine how South African lives have been ruined through Nigerian nyaope along. Not a city, town or village is without nyaope addicts. Families have been torn apart & destroyed. We are talking MILLIONS of South Africans! #NigeriansMustGo #NigeriansMustFutsek !”. Combined, these tweets received 54 retweets and just over 100 likes. 

\#PutSouthAfricansFirst trended again, within the conversation of jobs being reserved for South Africans first. On Saturday uLerato_Pillay [tweeted,](https://twitter.com/uLerato_pillay/status/1279336527395467266) “The ANC Government warns against inciting violence against Foreigners, According to the Government those who say #PutSouthAfricansFirst will be arrested because South Africans are not supposed to voice their concerns. be ready for harassment”. This tweet was accompanied by images of a press release that uLerato explained was made by Phumla Williams, Director-General of the Government Communications and Information System. Williams had said a poster on social media incited violence against foreign nationals and called on law enforcement services to take action against people spreading this type of hatred online.

Later, @Lungah_ tweeted: “South Africans have never known what it’s like to have a government that works for you. It was apartheid and straight after that we’ve had the ANC government who’s incompetence and corruption has been astounding and now we are forced to accommodate millions of illegal foreigners.” This post was retweeted close to 150 times. The comments that followed were mostly about the failure of the ANC government to improve life for poor South Africans.

**Race and gender**

Black women took to Twitter to question the tendency to ‘humble’ Black women. @Sundanesebih [asked](https://twitter.com/sudanesebih/status/1278781070264107010): “Why does the world always try and humble black women?” The tweet received over 27 600 likes, 105 900 likes and 484 comments, most echoing her sentiment.

[@Fanm_Anbusye](https://twitter.com/Fanm_Anbisye/status/1278995164900589580) then tweeted: “I'm going to be very real here and it might be seen as controversial but idc. It is not about jealousy or intimidation, it is about maintaining a hierarchy. It is a social strategy to keep people who they see as beneath them to also see themselves as the bottom.” This response received 946 likes and 92 retweets by today.

@Blackmedusamoon [highlighted inconsistencies](https://twitter.com/blackmedusamoon/status/1279480786580889600): “When a Black woman spoils her man, she is praised. When a Black woman gets spoiled, she gets backlash. When a Black woman spoils herself, Black people, including Black women, discredit her. This obsession with ‘humbling’ Black women needs to stop. ‘Our place’ is always to benefit someone else, not ourselves.” The tweet received over 14 800 retweets, 51 900 likes and 110 comments.

*@Jas commented:* “And what they REALLY mean by stay modest & humble is ‘stay down here at my level. Don’t do better than me. I don’t think luxury or finer things are possible for me so they ain’t for you!’”.

Bernice King, the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr, shared a video post of her late father speaking on Black slavery and racial injustice in America.
