**Tale of two pandemics**

The top topic of the day on social media was “President Cyril Ramaphosa”. His address to the nation covered the two pandemics raging through South Africa: the economic and social impact of COVID-19 and rampant violence against women and children.

The easing of lockdown regulations announced to address economic hardship did not go far enough for some. While many social media activists welcomed the President’s stance against gender-based violence, some called for stronger action, not strong words.

@News24 [tweeted at 20:22](https://twitter.com/News24/status/1273320036623699971): “President Cyril Ramaphosa announces that restaurants, hair salons, conferences, casinos and cinemas will reopen.” The post was retweeted 773 times and received over 2 200 likes. Within the first 200 comments, people were asking “[What about gyms](https://twitter.com/Tzzy_Teb/status/1273324831048638464)?” and demanding “I want my fkn cigarettes back”. 

At 21:50 @Our_DA*tweeted*: “President Ramaphosa's announcement tonight of a further lifting of lockdown restrictions is an admission that the lockdown serves no purpose and has failed - @jsteenhuisen #LockdownSA”. This post was retweeted 54 times and received 138 likes. The tweet included[ a link to an article](https://www.da.org.za/2020/06/the-worlds-longest-hard-lockdown-and-not-covid19-killed-our-economy) by the DA’s John Steenhuisen: “The world’s longest hard lockdown, and not Covid19, killed our economy.”

@MapsMaponyane [expressed joy](https://twitter.com/MapsMaponyane/status/1273320967046119426) that the barber was going to be open again. His tweet included an Usher music video and was retweeted 122 times and liked over 1 000 times by early this morning.

**Women with names**

The President was appalled by the violence that is being perpetrated against women and children, and spoke out strongly against the violent, abusive perpetrators.

At 20:28, @mbali_ndlela [tweeted a quote](https://twitter.com/mbali_ndlela/status/1273321570086326273) from the President’s speech: “These women are not just statistics. They have names. They have families and friends.” The post received over 200 retweets and 993 likes by today.

@Arweqane[added](https://twitter.com/arweqane/status/1273346617454845953): “He did well by taking the time to reflect and name them. I commend that!!”. @UlrichJvV also[ took to twitter during the address](https://twitter.com/UlrichJvV/status/1273321336077791234): “About time President Ramaphosa addressed GBV!! Thank you.” This post has been retweeted more than 240 times and received over 1 400 likes. Some responders to Ulrich’s tweet demanded more than lip service: “[We need action](https://twitter.com/SugaDuc/status/1273321587324997632)!”

Actress [@Ramichuene](https://twitter.com/ramichuene/status/1273323914257719297) discussed the President’s views about the influence of alcohol on gender-based violence: “We can’t hide men’s behaviour behind alcohol abuse. Men kill in season and out of season, they kill day and night, they kill when drunk and when sober, they kill pushed and totally unprovoked. Men kill, period my President @CyrilRamaphosa #LockdownSA.” The tweet received 1 200 retweets, 4 900 likes and 110 comments by this morning.

Many South Africans called for harsher punishment for acts of gender-based violence. [@RamiChuene](https://twitter.com/ramichuene/status/1273322848040431616) tweeted: “Swift arrests, no bail, harsher punishment please my President @CyrilRamaphosa #GBV is rife.

I don’t have time to sweet talk you through the revolution.” The tweet received over 14 800 retweets and 47 900 likes by today.
