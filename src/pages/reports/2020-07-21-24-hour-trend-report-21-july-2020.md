**Oppressed women**

Conversations about the oppression of black women trended on Twitter yesterday after @Chris_Moagi shared a [thread](https://twitter.com/Chris_Moagi/status/1285140505295228930) with videos and photographs of people protesting: “Women from Dobsonville, Soweto are out in the street protesting after there has been cases of rape and housebreaking. They are saying police are not helping women who are under seige in the area and they don't feel safe.” This generated 809 retweets and 783 likes.

Later @wildfonts retweeted an original [post](https://twitter.com/mhealananda/status/1284855634282909696) by @mhealananda from the weekend: “Why are so many black men horrifically violent toward women?
