**Borrowing billions**

The recently announced R70b IMF loan to South Africa for COVID-19 relief featured prominently in social media conversations in the last 24 hours. This hot-button issue prompted mass engagement on Twitter. Conversations related to this theme helped drive #corruptionmustfall to become the fourth most used hashtag for the day.

In the last 24 hours, two tweets about issues surrounding the governance of these funds gained significant traction. The most widely retweeted and commented on [tweet](https://twitter.com/iamkoshiek/status/1287992325151629312) was authored by @iamkoshiek, with 1 300 retweets and 2 800 comments. He pointed out that the IMF loan benefits from global scrutiny, leaving “no room for unexplained leakages.” He goes on to warn that “looting an IMF loan is the kiss of death for a country's global trade.” However, @ermbates expressed concern that corruption may still ensue. He [tweet](https://twitter.com/ermbates/status/1287822105602654210)ed, “How will [@GovernmentZA](https://twitter.com/GovernmentZA) ensure the loan does not become yet another feeding trough for the corrupt?” This tweet received only 100 retweets and comments and 250 likes.

This 24-hour cycle featured a number of trending posts that voiced clear objections to the IMF loan. @Lungah__ [notes](https://twitter.com/Lungah__/status/1287838439686144000) that before lockdown, South Africa was downgraded to junk status by Moody’s before asking “why would IMF borrow a broke country money?” This tweet received 1 200 retweets and comments and 3 500 likes.

@AdvoBarryRoux [tweeted](https://twitter.com/AdvoBarryRoux/status/1288094477383606274) that the original COVID relief package of R500b has resulted in “nothing tangible” and predicts that the R70b IMF loan will only “add on the already existing pain of peasants.” This tweet received only 150 retweets and comments and 600 likes.

@hostilenativ [claimed](https://twitter.com/hostilenativ/status/1287824448721223680): “South Africa will never be able to pay back that $4.3 Billion from IMF” and that the funds will be used to buy PPE at “1000% markup”. This tweet gained some attention and was retweeted 270 times and liked 450 times.

@BlessingsRamoba, the “Official Twitter page of the President of Mining Forum of South Africa (MFSA),” [tweeted](https://twitter.com/BlessingsRamoba/status/1287857131333591046): “Why do the IMF and other institutions still lend money to South Africa, so the ANC government can continue looting. The pain of paying tax in South Africa, and watch helplessly as the ANC enrich themselves with it. The post apartheid government is as bad as the apartheid regime.” This post received 300 retweets and nearly 1 000 likes.

@TomEatonSA authored a satirical [tweet](https://twitter.com/TomEatonSA/status/1287829391075086338) congratulating “all the Range Rover dealerships in Sandton and bankers in Dubai whose 2020 has just improved dramatically,” implying that they would benefit from the R70b IMF loan. This post trended with 1 300 retweets and shares and nearly 4 000 likes.
