**Fight the stigma**

Following a weekend of unprecedented daily increases in the confirmed number of COVID-19 cases in South Africa, many Twitter users continued to share their views and personal experiences. “COVID-19” and “tested positive” were both top trending topics yesterday, and COVID-19-related posts contributed to high volumes in the top topics by mention.

Emerging narratives around COVID-19 include fighting the stigma associated with testing positive, how to cope with COVID and its broader impacts, and remembering those who have succumbed to the virus.

President Cyril Ramaphosa said last week that the stigma associated with the virus must be combated for South Africa to overcome the pandemic. Two public personalities, Lerato Zah (@lerato_zah) and Lesedi Mashale (@lesedimashale) both tweeted that they had tested positive for the virus. @lerato_zah’s [tweet](https://twitter.com/lerato_zah/status/1280131245922541568) included a video describing her difficult experience that was watched almost 140 000 times. The tweet was liked over 10 000 times and retweeted over 3 500 times, with many replies conveying support and well wishes. @lesedimashale’s tweet was liked over 5 400 times and retweeted over 400 times.

These posts are examples of what @Joseline_xx [called](https://twitter.com/Joseline_xx/status/1279820345948528641) for: “Remove the stigma around Covid. Please. If you test positive, inform people.” This tweet was liked over 14 000 times and retweeted over 5 400 times.

Many other Twitter users shared their experiences of the virus and how to cope once it affects you or your loved ones. @ali_naka [advised](https://twitter.com/ali_naka/status/1279999838646607872): “If you are infected with #COVID19 and there is enough room to self isolate/ Quarantine at home, please do so! You stand a better chance of survival than being admitted in hospital”. The tweet concluded with the hashtags #staysafe #stayhome, and was liked over 1 600 times. This is timely advice, given that @Dispatch_DD [reported](https://twitter.com/Dispatch_DD/status/1280073773476175872) that all hospital beds in the Eastern Cape are now occupied.

Globally, more is being learned about the virus. A recent study by over 200 doctors has determined that the virus is airborne, according to a [tweet](https://twitter.com/DrEricDing/status/1279749506037317634) by @DrEricDing which was liked over 15 000 times and retweeted almost 13 000 times.

Despite these discoveries, there still appears to be pockets of denial around the pandemic’s existence. @BBCAfrica [shared](https://twitter.com/BBCAfrica/status/1280076422875353088) this information: “As coronavirus cases continue to be on the rise, in some countries, people still don't believe the pandemic is real”. This tweet was shared with a trailer to a new documentary on the Nigerian healthcare system and its response to the pandemic.

**Reality of Death** 

Despite our personal and collective efforts to combat the virus, the reality is that over 3 000 people have already died in South Africa from COVID-19. @Busisiwe_G released an hour-long documentary chronicling the lives of some South Africans whose lives have been claimed by the virus. The video has been viewed over 6 000 times so far.

@eNCA [announced](https://twitter.com/eNCA/status/1280199721114636289) in a tweet that was liked over 300 times: “COVID-19 has claimed the life of another one of our colleagues. Michael Wilson was part of our graphics team and he joined our eTV brand almost two decades ago. Our condolences go out to his family and friends.”

As South Africa’s schools move towards a complete reopening, @IOL [reported](https://twitter.com/IOL/status/1279788769927999489): “Eleven teachers and 3 pupils have died, while 2 740 teachers and 1 260 learners have tested positive for Covid-19 since the reopening of schools last month”. The tweet was retweeted over 130 times.

@dejachanels tweeted a passionate plea to “please please please wear your masks”, announcing that her brother had just passed away as a result of COVID-19. The thread continued to gain traction, with almost 100 000 retweets and almost 500 000 likes globally.

**Are we lazy?**

\#SouthAfricansAreNotLazy trended within the third most popular topic for the day. It received close to 10 000 mentions for the day, with just over 7 000 unique authors on Twitter. The first use of the hashtag for the day was [tweeted by @KnowMashaba](https://twitter.com/KnowMashaba/status/1279948932357947392). The tweet includes a photograph of black people hanging onto the outside of an overloaded train.

Commenting on the state of railway transport in South Africa, @ThisIsPalo [tweeted:](https://twitter.com/ThisIsPalo/status/1280245637511032832) “South Africa could use a really good railway system for the poor but we will take blankets and inspiring convoys”. This post has been retweeted around 900 times at the time of writing.

@njabzy responded with a similar sentiment when he [commented,](https://twitter.com/_njabzy/status/1280367193134379013) “A good railway system for everyone. Once you say for the ‘poor’, ulahlile because they will do shoddy work. We all deserve equal treatment especially in a democratic country. They must provide quality service like they do to the rich.” Many comments lauded @ThisIsPalo for the tweet asking them not to delete it and calling it a “banger”.

@PatriotMarc and @uLerato_Pillay contributed to the #SouthAfricansAreNotLazy conversation through a series of tweets published throughout the day. @PatriotMarc [felt that](https://twitter.com/PatriotMarc/status/1280070485099925504) liberals are not giving South Africans a fair chance because they hire illegal foreigners, adding that we need South Africa “back from leftists and foreigners”. His post was retweeted more than 100 times and received 248 likes.

@uLerato_Pillay [tweeted tha](https://twitter.com/uLerato_pillay/status/1280013608164917248)t, “Politicians are greedy and they have always put the interest of their children first. They have made sure their children are secured with financial independence and prosperous future. South Africans shall be put first without their approval #SouthAfricansAreNotLazy”. This tweet has been retweeted 89 times and received 179 likes.

One of the responders [commented tha](https://twitter.com/patrick01213/status/1280026021031485440)*t* the President’s son owns 35 companies and that each is worth R700 million; however, another person responded to these figures saying “Prove.plz”. The person who tweeted the figures did not provide the source of the information.

**Vilifying foreign drivers**

At 21:00 yesterday @PatriotMarc shared screenshots of a WhatsApp message that has allegedly been shared by truck drivers who are not South African citizens. The post, which has been retweeted 69 times, said: “This FOREIGNERS and Ali Nika also threatened @uLerato__pillay and @HermanMashaba South Africans Foreigners attacked our policemen and now they feel they can scare us @PennyLebyane you see what you brought in South Africa? #PutSouthAfricansFirst”. It is unclear from the WhatsApp screenshot who the original message was sent, but it refers to foreign truck drivers having sourced bullets to be prepared to fight.

@uLerato_Pillay [tweeted](https://twitter.com/uLerato_pillay/status/12802052263483596) two images of a smashed VW golf and another image of a man’s bloodied face saying that foreign truck drivers had attacked the man who, she claims, was an off-duty South African truck driver. Although this information was not verified, people still chose to retweet her story 365 times and some even commented about taking action against the alleged attack.

**Depressed Parents**

Two Twitter posts highlighted mental health issues faced within families, specifically between children and parents. One tweet highlighted a toxic parental relationship, while another highlighted a proactive parental relationship in combating depression. [@TiddyPlatter tweeted](https://twitter.com/TiddyPlatter/status/1280153624748883974), “Guys jokes aside. Our parents are toxic and refuse to take accountability”. The tweet received over 15 800 likes, 5 300 retweets and 265 comments, with followers stating that it is not true for all parents, while other followers asked her to seek help and highlighted the insensitivity of some uncalled-for comments.

@TanveerJeewa described the lack of support she received from her parents when dealing with depression. She tweeted, “The first time I got diagnosed with depression & got put on anti-depressants, the doctor asked my dad if he thinks I am getting better and what he thinks the cause of my depression could be. Dad dead-ass said: ‘I don’t know... could be the war in Syria, she watches the news a lot.’” The tweet received 3 likes and 1 300 retweets.

Meanwhile, [Bongiwe_Amy highlighted the support](https://twitter.com/Bongiwe_Amy/status/1280187370592178177) she received from her dad when dealing with depression, describing how he informed the family about her depression and how everyone needs to be mindful. She tweeted, “my dad made an appointment with my therapist so she can explain to him what depression & anxiety is. He then called a family meeting & said ‘layikhaya kunomuntu ongekho right & kuzomele sonke sibeResponsible futhi simusizi. Nathi sibe conscious ngesifo sakhe & how we contribute.’” The tweet received over 13 400 likes, 3 500 retweets and 384 comments, with users commenting that she has an amazing family and a supportive father.
