**Divided over gatherings**

Bishop Melusi Mphumlwana, General Secretary, of the South African Council of Churches, welcomed President Cyril Ramaphosa’s announcement that religious gaatherings would resume from 1 June.\
Lockdown regulations were the 8th biggest topic of the day by volume, driven by SA Zionist Church Bishop Bheki Ngcobo’s view that 50 people were too few for his gatherings - and his request for compensation over lost revenue during lockdown.\

Some of the businesses will not survive and vulnerable households have lost a lot of income.”Minister Dlamini-Zuma also featured in online conversations after her motivation behind maintaining the ban on selling tobacco was submitted to the high court in Pretoria on Wednesday.
