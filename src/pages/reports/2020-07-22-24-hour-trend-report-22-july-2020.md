**Succumbing**

The devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic trended yesterday as the daily number of reported cases hit its highest level yet.

A day after Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe was hospitalised due to COVID-19 related symptoms, the Minister of Employment and Labour Thulas Nxesi was also admitted to hospital due to COVID-19, according to a [tweet by News24](https://twitter.com/News24/status/1285491178528559104). The tweet received 575 likes, 274 retweets and 172 comments by this morning.

The official Twitter account of the [Presidency of South Africa also tweeted about the hospitalisation of the Minister Nxesi](https://twitter.com/PresidencyZA/status/1285487937833054211): “Minister of Employment and Labour, Mr Thembelani ‘Thulas’ Nxesi, was admitted to hospital last night due to Covid-19, on the advice of his medical doctors, in order for him to have access to better medical attention and proper monitoring.”

[@KleinhansMK commented](https://twitter.com/KleinhansMk/status/1285497220515725312): “Ai man look at God. One by one they follow each other. People's tears will never be in vain. Pity he's not at a public hospital. Covid-19 will show you flames no matter your title.”

[Zanele Lwana](https://twitter.com/ZaneleLwana/status/1285495024055197696) posted: “Can the politicians falling sick as a result of contracting Covid 19 be taken to the public hospitals they provide for Black people? Can Gwede Mantashe & Thulas Nxesi be taken to 1. Baragwanath hospital 2. Thembisa hospital 3. Mthatha General Hospital 4. Khayelitsha hospital?”

[@SmileyjeanJ replied](https://twitter.com/SmileyjeanJ/status/1285538070436155392): “Yes I agree. These politicians and ministers are in charge of providing services & funding for us. They must know what the services feel like. If it's not good enough for them, why should it be ok for us. They must lay in govt. hospitals, after all they represent us, so represent”.

Meanwhile [@Anelisa\_Theo\_](https://twitter.com/Anelisa_Theo_/status/1285547712675565569)clarified things like this: “A drug dealer does not use drugs, Tavern owners don't drink alcohol, Politicians don't send their kids to public schools, the only public thing that politicians use is taxpayers money. There are no good people in politics. That's general knowledge.”

**Surviving**

Meanwhile, an @ewnreporter [tweeted](https://twitter.com/ewnreporter/status/1285606454771224577) an [article](https://ewn.co.za/2020/07/21/93-year-old-ma-newman-from-w-cape-beats-covid-19) about Ma Newman, a 93 year old woman from Cape Town who beat COVID-19 after testing positive in June. The article described the challenges she had to overcome during her lifetime. The tweet received nearly 100 comments and retweets and 500 likes by today.

**Tender bender**

Both the EFF and Herman Mashaba shared news on Twitter about a R125 million personal protective equipment supply tender awarded to the President's Spokesperson, Khusela Diko's husband.

[Herman Mashaba shared a post with a Newsroom Afrika video detailing the tender](https://twitter.com/HermanMashaba/status/1285173729572671494), “Listen to this. The husband of @CyrilRamaphosa's Spokesperson scored a R125 million contract to supply the government with personal protective equipment! South Africa and the ANC cannot exist in mutual prosperity – one must give way and it cannot be South Africa!” The tweet received over 14 000 views, 863 likes, 449 retweets and 105 comments.

Meanwhile, [the EFF shared an official statement on the PPE tender](https://twitter.com/EFFSouthAfrica/status/1285579354156695554), claiming that the tender was awarded to Presidency Spokesperson’s husband, Madzikane Diko days after the President declared a national lockdown against the spread of COVID-19. Furthermore it appears that the cost of the PPE (including biohazard health care waste, disposable bags, surgical masks and sanitisers) were inflated above the regulated price. The EFF tweet received 536 likes and 267 retweets.

**Under fire**

There were many expressions of discontent toward the South African and Zimbabwean governments on Twitter yesterday.

At 12:14 @uLerato_Pillay [tweeted that](https://twitter.com/uLerato_pillay/status/1285337261815595016) poverty in the country was real, people were starving, and that there was no help coming from the government. The post was retweeted more than 60 times and it received 138 likes. There were only 6 comments to the post and all of them reflected the opinion of the initial tweet.

The EFF’s Mbuyiseni Ndlozi [criticised the leading party](https://twitter.com/MbuyiseniNdlozi/status/1285491743857704962) in the Western Cape and their opposition, saying that the DA were the “lowest order of political imagination”, and that they were similar to the post-1994 ANC. His post was retweeted more than 500 times and received close to 3 000 likes.

The EFF also received criticism, with one responder [claiming that](https://twitter.com/FundakuyeM/status/1285493717944721409) the EFF acted like they were on the side of the poor, but were actually “For The Bellies Of Their Own Lusts”. [Another commented](https://twitter.com/TheeBandisa/status/1285544910859444224) that it was the EFF who was the lowest order of political imagination because of their stance toward foreigners.
