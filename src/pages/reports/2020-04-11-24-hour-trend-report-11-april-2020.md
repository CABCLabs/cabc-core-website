**11 April 2020**

**Lockdown extension**

\
Following President Ramaphosa’s address, there has been a persistent social conversation around the lockdown extension. The lockdown occupied approximately 51% of the Covid-19 conversation on 10 April. Specific narratives included those sharing, supporting or criticising the decision.

**Announcement**

The Presidential address on 9 April was expected to dominate social media engagement on 10 April 2020. However, volumes were at a much lower level than expected (about 7% of total conversation).

Interestingly, the largest spikes in conversation on this narrative are on the lockdown enforcement.

Most conversations focused on general news sharing. About 38% was original content and the remainder included re-tweets and shares of others’ content, which was rather unusual.

**Praise and support**

About 13.5% of the Covid-19 conversation supported the President's decision.

There is a clear community who are aligned, vocal and supportive of the mission.

The largest spike in conversation occurred between noon and 1pm as data was released showing how our early efforts have already reduced infection rates across the country.

General conversation applauds the President as a strong, decisive and “people first” leader.

**Criticism and opposition**

Opposition and criticism, on the other hand, remains present but is not a significant component of the overall conversation.

Of the volume that was observed, a significant percentage was driven by a News24 article which noted that various Muslim theologians (representing 20 mosques) were planning on taking the issue of the lockdown to the courts.

Negative sentiments remain low overall - a good sign of a shift in national culture towards standing together against a common enemy. While this may not have manifested throughout the country, it’s clear that the majority of the public don’t want to be seen as opposing or resisting “what’s good for the country”.

**Lockdown enforcement**

**\
Several high profile charges were laid and arrests made as a result of lockdown enforcement. Approximately 16.6% of total conversation online was driven by this theme yesterday. Minister Mbalula’s charge against Somizi Mhlongo was in the top ten topics by volume. Nkandla Mayor Ntuli’s arrest formed part of the top three trending topics on Twitter. The arrest of three TMPD officers in relation to a bribe features among the top three new stories yesterday.**

**Somizi Mhlongo**

Television and radio personality Somizi Mhlongo found himself in hot water as Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula laid charges against him for contravening the State of Disaster Act and lock down rules.

Hours before the Presidential address on Friday, Mhlongo divulged on an Instagram live story that the lockdown would be extended. He claimed to have received his information from Minister Mbalula.

Mbalula has subsequently denied all claims of divulging any information relating to the lockdown extension. In a media statement released yesterday, Mbulala stated that these claims by Somizi undermined the President's Office and are a breach of national security, all in the name of “name dropping”.

The Minister laid charges against Mhlongo yesterday at the Sandton Police Station for contravening lockdown rules.

**Thami Ntuli**

In yet another high profile lockdown enforcement case, Nkandla Mayor Thami Ntuli was arrested, and later granted bail, for contravening lockdown rules.

His version of events state that the Mayor, along with other officials from his municipality headed to a local taxi rank to hand out food parcels ahead of the Easter weekend. They requested street hawkers come one by one to collect their parcels when the situation got unruly. Ntuli claims at this point he and his team decided to close the programme and left the Taxi Rank.

Soon after, a call from local police informed him that they had received orders from above to arrest him and his officials. Mayor Ntuli alleges the arrest was politically motivated and claims the Premier wanted to be the only one executing such programs.

**Tshwane police bribe**

Three Tshwane Metro Police Officers were arrested on the afternoon of 9 April after allegedly demanding a bribe of R7000 from a foreign national.

The officers stopped the foreign national’s car in Tshwane CBD where they informed him he could not drive during the lockdown and demanded the bribe. All parties then drove towards Bronkhorstspruit, where the foreign national resides. The officers parked at a garage and waited to collect the bribe.

Meanwhile, someone had tipped off TMPD and SAPS, who arrived at the garage and found the three officials with money that could not be accounted for. All three officials were arrested for corruption.

**Forced quarantine**

**\
Cases of forced action on the African continent are increasingly coming to light. In Botswana MPs who do not self isolate are put under state quarantine.**

**In South Africa a number of doctors who tested positive for Covid-19 have been detained by the Health Officials.**

**Forced action against the poor and homeless people are coming into focus.**

**The Strandfontein Relocation Camp in Cape Town has become an example of failure to provide adequately for the homeless.**

**Strandfontein relocation camp**

Over the past few weeks, conversation and controversy surrounding the forced relocation of homeless people has been a constant feature in South African social media.

Concerns, actions and statements by local and international organisations regarding the Strandfontein Relocation Camp drove an increase in volume of conversation in this narrative, as well as a significant increase in the number of unique authors.

Amnesty International expressed concerns about police conduct, while local groups are stressing possible rights violations as a result of the higher risk of infection, forced detention and lack of mental health support.

**Limpopo doctors**

Two doctors in Limpopo, with the support of the South African Medical Association (SAMA), were released from Modimolle MDR-TB facility where they were being “detained” by the provincial Department of Health.

The doctors had tested positive for Covid-19 but were not allowed to self-quarantine. The Department’s actions led these individuals to seek a court order for their release.

An agreement was reached and the doctors were allowed to go home on 7 April.

The Department issued a press release stating that their release was based on the doctors testing negative for the virus, although there is some suspicion around the truth of this statement.

**Botswana MPs**

Three members of Parliament in Botswana have been placed under state quarantine after they violated the self-isolation order. Images of the three MPs shopping and interacting with the public at a mall went viral on Botswana social media, alerting their superiors.

The conversation flowed smoothly between South Africa and Botswana, especially once newspapers published articles that could easily be shared and retweeted.

**Payment relief**

**\
Interestingly, the single-handed actions of one individual has driven the prominence of this theme. The public is putting pressure on insurance providers, and showing gratitude towards banks who took decisions to ease debt and repayment. With a total of 18% of the conversation relating to the Payment Relief theme, it’s a significant overall contributor to the Covid-19 conversation in general.**

**Car insurance**

Tumi Sole posted a tweet on 8 April at about 9am putting pressure on the insurance industry to reduce premiums.

With 4800 retweets, 4200 likes and 687 replies in the first 12hrs of the post, this post continued to grow (but at a lower rate) over the next 24 hours.

At present the post has 831 replies, 5800 retweets and 5200 likes - amounting to an interaction with the post every 5 minutes since posting.

**Banks**

Occupying a very small percentage of total conversation (2%), the banking conversation is largely dominated by consumers' reactions to various moves by the banking sector to ease the pressure on the average citizen through debt support for secured and unsecured loans.

Overall, FNB appears to be best performing. FNB messaging is being re-posted by consumers with words of thanks and appreciation.

**Salary cuts and donations**

**\
Since the President’s address, various groups have decided to reduce salaries and contribute towards the Covid-19 cause. Despite the scale of the gesture and the impact on the individuals who have taken the salary reduction, social media is largely non-responsive, with only 7% of the conversation discussing this theme.**

**Government officials**

Despite the President’s announcement, social media’s reaction to government officials taking a salary cut is very low.

While it is represented in the media, it lacks resonance in social media.

Why this is the case is not clear. It may be due to citizens’ expectations of similar decisions in future.

**Opposition parties**

Various actions by opposition parties triggered conversation within the social media community.

In particular, the EFF took a 33% salary reduction across the board.

The Democratic Alliance is quoted as being against the lockdown as it will lead to “economic disaster”.

**Private sector**

As with the social media response to Government Officials taking a reduction in salary, the response to the private sector’s decisions to reduce salaries was equally small.

It may be too soon to fully understand why this is the case.

**Support efforts**

**\
On Thursday, President Ramaphosa indicated that one of the biggest challenges in fighting this pandemic was the lack of medical equipment. The response to this has been swift and immense, with companies like Ford ramping up to produce pandemic supplies. Another creative solution was recommended by the smoking citizens of SA who would accept a higher Cigarette Excise duty to be donated to the Solidarity Fund, if the ban was lifted.**

**The highest trending topics for 10 April was largely driven by the Cigarette Excise Duty and Ford Motor Company narratives.**

**Cigarette excise duty**

Since the beginning of the lockdown, various actions have been observed both by the cigarette manufacturers and the public.

The first thread is around the public’s request for access to cigarettes - offering R10 per packet more to create an offset. The second thread focused on the tax implications (quoted at R525m in lost taxes since lockdown).

While overall volume remains very low, there is a community who remains active.

**Ford Motor Company**

As part of a continuing spirit of corporate donations and volunteerism to support Covid-19, The Ford Motor Company SA has started producing over 57000 protective shields which will be donated to front line medical staff and essential services personnel.

Ford has also asked for additional support for the project from individuals and other companies wanting to contribute to this effort. This is an example of corporations using excess production capacity to assist the pandemic with goods.

The effort is likely to spark other large corporate donations in the private sector, following the example of Woolworths and Naspers.

End.
